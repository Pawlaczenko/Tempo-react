Tempo is a website, where you can test your typing speed using your favorite songs. Just search for a song, artist, or album and you'll get the results.

Type the lyrics as fast as you can and see how well you do. Five keystrokes are equivalent of one word. One error is one misspelled character. Your final wpm(words per minute) score is calculated by the following equation:

(number of words - number of errors) / Time

To start your test, search for your favourite song, artist or album, then choose one song from the results. Now you just have to start typing as fast as you can. When you finish, your WPM(words per minute) score will show, with additional statistics.

This app is a remake of https://github.com/Pawlaczenko/Tempo done with React.js and Node.js. I wanted to do this app justice. The main reason that pushed me to rewriting Tempo was to give it a proper backend with error handling.
