![Tempo Logo](/client/src/assets/images/logo.png)

Tempo is a captivating website that allows you to put your typing skills to the test while enjoying your favorite songs. With Tempo, you can search for any song, artist, or album and receive instant results. Once you've found the perfect song, it's time to demonstrate your typing prowess.

## How it works

1. Visit the Tempo website at https://tempo-react.netlify.app/
2. Search for your favorite song, artist, or album.
3. Select a song from the results that match your search.
4. Start typing the lyrics as fast as you can.
5. The app will calculate your typing speed using the following formula: *WPM (Words Per Minute) = (Number of Words - Number of Errors) / Time*
6. Once you've finished typing, your final WPM score will be displayed, along with additional statistics.

## Why Tempo?

Tempo offers a more fun typing speed testing experience compared to other platforms. Its standout features include:

+ **Song-based Typing**: Enjoy the process of typing by syncing it with your favorite songs. Experience a unique and immersive way to measure your typing skills.
+ **Accurate Results**: Tempo's algorithm calculates your WPM score, taking into account the number of words, errors, and the time taken to type.
+ **User-friendly Interface**: The sleek and intuitive design of Tempo makes it easy to navigate and enjoy your typing tests without any distractions.
+ **Error Handling**: Tempo has a backend that ensures smooth performance and error handling, providing a seamless experience for users.

**Please note that this typing test is not designed to provide an accurate representation of your WPM score. Many song lyrics are structured in a way that is not ideal for measuring typing speed.**

This app is a redesigned version of the original Tempo application available at https://github.com/Pawlaczenko/Tempo. With the use of React.js and Node.js, I aimed to create an improved rendition of Tempo. The main focus of this rewrite was to provide a robust backend with effective error handling capabilities.
